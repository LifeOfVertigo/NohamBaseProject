# Story 2.2: shadcn Component Integration

**Status:** Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** shadcn UI components working within NEON widgets,
**so that** I can leverage modern web UI patterns for rapid menu development with consistent styling.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. shadcn component library integrated into NEON rendering context
2. Basic components (buttons, inputs, cards) render correctly in UE5
3. shadcn theming system adapted for game UI requirements
4. Component styling responsive to different screen resolutions
5. Integration documented with component usage examples

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Set up shadcn/ui in NEON context (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Install shadcn/ui in `Content/UI/NEON/package.json`
  - [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS for shadcn components
  - [ ] Set up Vite bundling for component compilation
  - [ ] Create shadcn components directory structure
- [ ] Implement core shadcn components (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create GameButton component wrapping shadcn Button
  - [ ] Create GameInput component wrapping shadcn Input
  - [ ] Create GameCard component wrapping shadcn Card
  - [ ] Create GameSlider component wrapping shadcn Slider
  - [ ] Test component rendering in NEON widget
- [ ] Adapt shadcn theming for game UI (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create game-specific theme configuration
  - [ ] Implement CSS custom properties for dynamic theming
  - [ ] Configure dark/light theme variants
  - [ ] Apply game aesthetic to component library
- [ ] Implement responsive design (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test components at different resolutions
  - [ ] Implement responsive breakpoints
  - [ ] Ensure UI scales properly across screen sizes
  - [ ] Test on Steam Deck target resolution
- [ ] Create documentation and examples (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Document component usage patterns
  - [ ] Create example implementations
  - [ ] Document theming customization
  - [ ] Create component library reference

## Dev Notes

**Tech Stack Reference:**
- shadcn/ui Latest (2025) for professional UI components [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Tailwind CSS 3.x required for shadcn components [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Vite 5.x for HTML/CSS/JS bundling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Framer Motion 11.x for UI animations [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Project Structure:**
- shadcn component library: `Content/UI/NEON/Components/shadcn/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Game-specific components: `Content/UI/NEON/Components/Game/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Component utilities: `Content/UI/NEON/Components/Utils/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Styles directory: `Content/UI/NEON/Styles/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Component Architecture:**
- Core components: GameButton, GameSlider, GameSelect, GameInput, GameCard [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Layout components: MenuContainer, SettingsTab, Modal, Notification [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- CSS organization: globals.css, components.css, animations.css [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**ComponentLibraryManager:**
- Shared shadcn component configurations and game-specific theming [Source: architecture/components.md]
- Interfaces: getButtonVariants(), getFormComponents(), getLayoutComponents() [Source: architecture/components.md]
- Technology: Complete shadcn/ui suite, Framer Motion, CSS custom properties [Source: architecture/components.md]

**Coding Standards:**
- Asset References: HTML/CSS/JS files must be treated as UE5 content assets [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Performance budget: NEON widgets limited to 3.5ms processing time per frame [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- CSS Classes use kebab-case naming [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- shadcn Components use PascalCase naming [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Previous Story Context:**
Story 2.1 established NEON plugin setup and basic communication, providing the foundation for shadcn component integration.

### Testing

**Testing Approach:**
- Jest + Testing Library for component testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Manual testing for visual rendering and responsiveness [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Performance testing for component load times [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- shadcn components render without errors
- Component theming applies correctly
- Responsive design works across resolutions
- Component interactions function properly

**Success Criteria:**
- All core components render correctly in NEON
- Theming system functional and customizable
- Components responsive across target resolutions
- Documentation complete and accurate
