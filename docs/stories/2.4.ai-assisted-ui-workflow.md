**Previous Story Context:**
Story 2.3 completed main menu implementation, providing a complete working example of NEON+shadcn integration for AI workflow documentation.

### Testing

**Testing Approach:**
- AI assistant validation with real prompts and templates
- Code generation quality assessment
- Template functionality verification
- Documentation accuracy testing

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- AI can generate functional menu components from prompts
- Templates produce working code when instantiated
- Generated code follows established patterns
- Workflow documentation enables successful development

**Success Criteria:**
- AI consistently generates usable code from prompts
- Templates accelerate development without errors
- Documentation enables independent AI-assisted development
- Workflow produces maintainable, standards-compliant code
