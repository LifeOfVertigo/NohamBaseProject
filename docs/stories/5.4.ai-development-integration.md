**Previous Story Context:**
Story 5.3 completed AI-focused documentation system, providing the documentation foundation that this story will extend with practical templates and tools for AI code generation.

### Testing

**Testing Approach:**
- AI assistant validation with template generation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Blueprint integration testing for generated code
- Code quality validation for AI-generated components
- Template effectiveness testing with real scenarios

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- AI can generate functional C++ components from templates
- Generated code integrates properly with Blueprint systems
- Naming conventions are applied consistently
- Component patterns work as expected in UE5

**Success Criteria:**
- Templates enable reliable AI code generation
- Generated code follows project standards
- Blueprint integration works seamlessly
- AI development workflow is significantly enhanced
