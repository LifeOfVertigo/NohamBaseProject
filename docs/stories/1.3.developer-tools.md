# Story 1.3: Basic Development Tools Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** essential development tools and debugging capabilities integrated into the base project,  
**so that** I can efficiently develop and troubleshoot during the foundation building phase.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Basic console commands implemented for common development tasks
2. Performance monitoring framework established (FPS display, memory usage)
3. Debug logging system configured with appropriate verbosity levels
4. Basic collision visualization tools available
5. Development menu accessible via function key (F1 or similar)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create DeveloperToolsSubsystem.h/.cpp with basic framework (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Create Source/NohamBaseProject/Public/Subsystems/Developer/DeveloperToolsSubsystem.h
  - [ ] Create Source/NohamBaseProject/Private/Subsystems/Developer/DeveloperToolsSubsystem.cpp
  - [ ] Implement UEngineSubsystem base class inheritance
  - [ ] Add F1 key binding for developer menu toggle
- [ ] Implement FPS counter and memory display (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create PerformanceMonitor.h/.cpp component
  - [ ] Display FPS using UE5 stat system integration
  - [ ] Show memory usage with GEngine->GetMaxTickRate()
  - [ ] Create on-screen debug widget for performance metrics
- [ ] Set up UE5 logging categories for base project systems (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Define logging categories in NohamBaseProject.h
  - [ ] Create log macros for different verbosity levels
  - [ ] Configure default log output to both console and file
- [ ] Create basic collision visualization toggle (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement collision debug draw commands
  - [ ] Add collision shape visualization (boxes, spheres, meshes)
  - [ ] Create toggle system for different collision types
- [ ] Implement F1 developer menu with initial options (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create basic NEON widget for developer menu
  - [ ] Add performance metrics toggle
  - [ ] Add collision visualization controls
  - [ ] Add log verbosity controls
- [ ] Add console commands for time scale, debug toggles (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Implement "SetTimeScale" console command
  - [ ] Implement "ToggleCollisionDebug" command
  - [ ] Implement "SetLogVerbosity" command

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Developer tools follow subsystem organization:
- **Source/NohamBaseProject/Private/Subsystems/Developer/**: Main developer subsystem
- **Source/NohamBaseProject/Public/Subsystems/Developer/**: Public interfaces
- Developer tools integrate with NEON UI system for visual interface

### Backend Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
DeveloperToolsSubsystem follows UE5 subsystem patterns:
- Inherit from UEngineSubsystem for global access
- Use UE5 logging categories for organized debug output
- Integrate with UE5 console command system
- Support both editor and packaged build execution

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Game Engine**: UE5 5.5.4 native debugging capabilities
- **Backend**: C++20 with UE5 Framework subsystem patterns
- **Monitoring**: UE5 Stats System for performance metrics
- **Logging**: UE5 Logging system with categorized output

### NEON Integration
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
Developer menu uses NEON widget system:
- Create developer.html in Content/UI/NEON/Developer/
- Use shadcn components for professional debug interface
- Integrate with UE5 bridge for real-time data updates

### File Structure Implementation
Based on backend-architecture.md:
```
Source/NohamBaseProject/
├── Private/Subsystems/Developer/
│   ├── DeveloperToolsSubsystem.cpp
│   ├── PerformanceMonitor.cpp
│   └── ConsoleCommandLibrary.cpp
└── Public/Subsystems/Developer/
    ├── DeveloperToolsSubsystem.h
    ├── PerformanceMonitor.h
    └── ConsoleCommandLibrary.h
```

### Console Command Implementation
Use UE5 UFUNCTION with CallInEditor=true:
```cpp
UFUNCTION(CallInEditor = true, Exec)
void SetTimeScale(float NewTimeScale);

UFUNCTION(CallInEditor = true, Exec)
void ToggleCollisionDebug();

UFUNCTION(CallInEditor = true, Exec)
void SetLogVerbosity(const FString& Category, const FString& Verbosity);
```

### Performance Monitoring Integration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use UE5 Stats System for native performance tracking
- Display metrics through NEON widget overlay
- Support toggle on/off for performance impact

### Previous Story Dependencies
[Source: Story 1.1]
- Requires standardized project structure from Story 1.1
- Uses established subsystem organization patterns
- Integrates with coding standards for naming conventions

### Testing
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Use UE5 Automation Framework for subsystem testing
- Test console command execution in both editor and runtime
- Verify F1 menu accessibility and functionality
- Test performance monitoring accuracy
