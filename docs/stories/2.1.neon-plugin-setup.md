# Story 2.1: NEON Plugin Setup & Configuration

**Status:** Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** NEON plugin properly integrated and configured in the UE5 project,
**so that** HTML/JavaScript UI components can be rendered within UE5 widgets and communicate with C++ game logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. NEON plugin installed and configured for UE5 5.5.4 compatibility
2. Basic HTML rendering test successful within UE5 widget
3. JavaScript-to-C++ communication channel established and tested
4. NEON widget creation workflow documented with examples
5. Performance baseline established for HTML rendering within UE5

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Install NEON plugin in UE5 project (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Download NEON plugin compatible with UE5 5.5.4
  - [ ] Place plugin in `Plugins/NEON/` directory
  - [ ] Enable plugin in project settings
  - [ ] Verify plugin compilation
- [ ] Create basic NEON widget setup (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create UMG widget blueprint for NEON container
  - [ ] Implement basic HTML rendering test
  - [ ] Test HTML content display in UE5 viewport
- [ ] Establish C++ to JavaScript communication (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create NEONBridgeSubsystem base class
  - [ ] Implement test event from UE5 to NEON
  - [ ] Implement test function call from NEON to UE5
  - [ ] Verify bidirectional communication
- [ ] Document NEON workflow patterns (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create step-by-step widget creation guide
  - [ ] Document C++ integration patterns
  - [ ] Create example implementations
- [ ] Establish performance baseline (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Measure HTML rendering performance
  - [ ] Test with different content sizes
  - [ ] Document performance expectations

## Dev Notes

**Tech Stack Reference:**
- UE5 5.5.4 with NEON plugin (May 28, 2025 version) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript ES2022 for UI development [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- UE5 Widget containers for NEON hosting [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Project Structure:**
- NEON plugin location: `Plugins/NEON/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- NEON content directory: `Content/UI/NEON/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- UMG widget containers: `Content/UI/Widgets/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- NEONBridgeSubsystem: `Source/NohamBaseProject/Private/Subsystems/NEON/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**NEONBridgeSubsystem Architecture:**
- Manages communication between UE5 systems and NEON widgets [Source: architecture/components.md]
- Key interfaces: SendToNEON(), RegisterNEONEvent(), RegisterNEONFunction() [Source: architecture/components.md]
- Technology: C++20, NEON Plugin, UE5 JSON, Blueprint Integration [Source: architecture/components.md]

**NEON Communication Layer:**
- Centralized NEON communication via NEONApiClient [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Supports async invoke() and send() patterns [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Error handling and request tracking included [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Coding Standards:**
- NEON Communication must go through NEONBridgeSubsystem [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- UE5 classes use UNoham/FNoham prefix [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All NEON events use consistent JSON structure with requestId, timestamp, data [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Performance budget: NEON widgets limited to 3.5ms processing time per frame [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Previous Story Context:**
Story 1.4 completed template system foundation which provides the base project structure for NEON integration.

### Testing

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests for NEONBridgeSubsystem using UE5 Automation Framework [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Integration tests for HTML rendering performance [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Manual testing for widget creation workflow [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- NEON plugin loads without errors
- Basic HTML content renders correctly
- Bidirectional communication functions
- Performance meets baseline requirements

**Success Criteria:**
- Plugin compiles and loads successfully
- HTML content visible in UE5 widget
- Communication functions execute without errors
- Performance baseline documented
