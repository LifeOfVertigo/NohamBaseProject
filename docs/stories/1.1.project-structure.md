# Story 1.1: Project Structure & AI-Readable Architecture

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a standardized UE5 project with AI-optimized file organization and naming conventions,  
**so that** AI assistants can quickly understand and extend the codebase while maintaining human readability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Existing UE5 5.5.4 project (Noham_Base_Proj_Cpp) restructured with clear folder structure separating base systems from game-specific code
2. C++ naming conventions documented and implemented following AI-readable patterns
3. File organization enables quick navigation for both humans and AI assistants
4. Basic project compiles and runs successfully in UE5 editor
5. README and development setup instructions created and validated

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Clean existing UE5 project structure, remove FPS template cruft (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Remove unnecessary template files from Source/ directory
  - [ ] Clean up Content/ folder from FPS template assets
  - [ ] Remove default level and character implementations
- [ ] Create standardized Source/ folder structure for base systems (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create Source/Noham_Base_Proj_Cpp/Private/Subsystems/ with subfolders
  - [ ] Create Source/Noham_Base_Proj_Cpp/Public/Subsystems/ with subfolders
  - [ ] Create Source/Noham_Base_Proj_Cpp/Private/Components/ structure
  - [ ] Create Source/Noham_Base_Proj_Cpp/Public/Components/ structure
- [ ] Implement naming conventions document (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create docs/coding-standards.md with C++ naming rules
  - [ ] Document AI-readable patterns and file organization
  - [ ] Include examples of proper class and file naming
- [ ] Create README.md with setup instructions (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Document prerequisites and setup steps
  - [ ] Include UE5 project file regeneration commands (for existing project)
  - [ ] Add build and development workflow instructions
- [ ] Validate project builds and runs in clean UE5 environment (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Regenerate UE5 project files for existing project using UnrealBuildTool
  - [ ] Build existing project in Visual Studio (Development Editor)
  - [ ] Launch UE5 editor and verify existing project loads without errors

## Dev Notes

### 🚨 CRITICAL: EXISTING PROJECT USAGE
**DO NOT CREATE NEW UE5 PROJECT**
- Use existing project: `Noham_Base_Proj_Cpp.uproject`
- Project location: `Source/Noham_Base_Proj_Cpp/`
- DO NOT run UE5 project creation wizards
- ONLY restructure and extend the existing project structure
- All references to "creating" mean restructuring existing directories

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
The project follows a hybrid UE5 + NEON architecture with specific folder organization:
- **Source/NohamBaseProject/**: C++ backend systems organized by subsystems and components
- **Content/UI/NEON/**: Frontend web assets for NEON integration
- **Subsystem Organization**: Settings, Input, Platform, NEON, Developer, Core subsystems
- **Component Organization**: Characters and UI components in separate folders

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Game Engine**: Unreal Engine 5.5.4 (exact version for consistency)
- **Backend Language**: C++20 with UE5 Framework
- **Build Tool**: Unreal Build Tool (UBT) 5.5.4
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio 2022 with C++ development tools

### Development Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- Project must support hot reload for C++ changes (Ctrl+Alt+F11)
- Structure must accommodate NEON plugin integration
- File organization should enable parallel web asset development
- Build configuration needs to support Development Editor builds

### File Structure Requirements
Based on unified-project-structure.md, implement:
```
Source/NohamBaseProject/
├── Private/
│   ├── Subsystems/
│   │   ├── Settings/
│   │   ├── Input/
│   │   ├── Platform/
│   │   ├── NEON/
│   │   ├── Developer/
│   │   └── Core/
│   ├── Components/
│   │   ├── Characters/
│   │   └── UI/
│   └── Data/
├── Public/
│   ├── Subsystems/
│   ├── Components/
│   └── Data/
├── NohamBaseProject.Build.cs
└── NohamBaseProject.h
```

### Testing
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Use UE5 Automation Framework for C++ testing
- Project structure must support integrated testing patterns
- Build configuration should enable test execution in editor
