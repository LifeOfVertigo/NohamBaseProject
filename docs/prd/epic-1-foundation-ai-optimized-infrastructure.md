# Epic 1: Foundation & AI-Optimized Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish the fundamental project structure, AI-readable code architecture, and essential development infrastructure while delivering a functional UE5 base project that demonstrates the standardized patterns and documentation system. This epic creates the foundation that enables all subsequent development and AI-assisted workflows.

### Story 1.1: Project Structure & AI-Readable Architecture
As a developer,
I want a standardized UE5 project with AI-optimized file organization and naming conventions,
so that AI assistants can quickly understand and extend the codebase while maintaining human readability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. UE5 5.5.4 project created with clear folder structure separating base systems from game-specific code
2. C++ naming conventions documented and implemented following AI-readable patterns
3. File organization enables quick navigation for both humans and AI assistants
4. Basic project compiles and runs successfully in UE5 editor
5. README and development setup instructions created and validated

### Story 1.2: Local Documentation System
As an AI assistant and developer,
I want comprehensive local documentation for UE5 C++, NEON plugin, and shadcn components,
so that development can proceed efficiently without external API lookups or token-heavy web searches.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. UE5 C++ API documentation downloaded and organized locally
2. NEON plugin documentation integrated into project structure
3. shadcn component library documentation available offline
4. Documentation access patterns established for AI assistant usage
5. Quick reference guides created for common development tasks

### Story 1.3: Basic Development Tools Integration
As a developer,
I want essential development tools and debugging capabilities integrated into the base project,
so that I can efficiently develop and troubleshoot during the foundation building phase.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Basic console commands implemented for common development tasks
2. Performance monitoring framework established (FPS display, memory usage)
3. Debug logging system configured with appropriate verbosity levels
4. Basic collision visualization tools available
5. Development menu accessible via function key (F1 or similar)

### Story 1.4: Template System Foundation
As a developer,
I want standardized templates for creating new classes and components,
so that all future development follows consistent patterns and AI assistants can predict code structure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. C++ class templates created for common UE5 component types
2. Header and implementation file templates follow established naming conventions
3. Template generation tools or scripts provided for rapid class creation
4. Example components created demonstrating template usage
5. Documentation explaining template patterns and usage guidelines
