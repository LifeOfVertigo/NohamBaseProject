# Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The base project shall provide a standardized C++ code structure with AI-readable naming conventions and file organization
**FR2:** The system shall integrate NEON plugin with shadcn UI components for HTML/JavaScript menu development within UE5 widgets
**FR3:** The base project shall include essential menu systems: main menu, settings (game/audio/graphics/keybinds/language), escape menu, basic HUD, and developer menu
**FR4:** The system shall provide a basic FPS character controller with first-person movement, crouch, jump, aim, and interact (E key) functionality
**FR5:** The base project shall implement settings management for graphics (resolution, fullscreen, VSync, FPS cap), audio (volume controls), and game settings with persistence
**FR6:** The system shall support multi-controller input framework with keyboard/mouse, gamepad, and Steam Deck support including context switching
**FR7:** The base project shall include development tools: time controls, performance metrics display, collision visualization, and function trigger menu
**FR8:** The system shall provide local documentation integration for shadcn, UE5 C++, and component documentation accessible to AI assistants

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** The base project must maintain stable 120+ FPS performance on medium hardware with low-poly/retro graphics optimization
**NFR2:** Setup time for new game projects using this base must be under 2 hours from copy to functional prototype
**NFR3:** Menu creation time must be under 1 day for complete game menu systems using AI assistance
**NFR4:** The system must achieve 95% Steam Deck compatibility without additional development work
**NFR5:** Code structure must enable >80% base code reusability across derived game projects
**NFR6:** Documentation lookup time must be under 30 seconds for any component or system reference
**NFR7:** The base project must maintain compatibility with UE5.5.4 and existing successful game project patterns
