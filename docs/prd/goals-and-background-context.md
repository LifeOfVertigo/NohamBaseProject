# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
Based on your Project Brief, here are the key desired outcomes for the NohamBaseProject PRD:

• **Accelerate prototype development** - Reduce development time by 50% through reusable base systems and AI-optimized architecture
• **Establish AI-readable codebase** - Create standardized C++ conventions and documentation that enable effective AI-assisted development  
• **Integrate NEON+shadcn UI system** - Enable rapid, beautiful menu creation using HTML/JavaScript within UE5 widgets
• **Build reusable foundation components** - Essential systems (character controller, input handling, settings management) for 100% reusability across projects
• **Enable multi-platform support** - Steam PC primary with Steam Deck compatibility and multi-controller input framework
• **Create comprehensive documentation system** - Local file-based documentation accessible to both AI assistants and human developers

### Background Context

NohamBaseProject addresses critical inefficiencies in indie game development for a small but successful studio (1-2 developers) with proven Steam PC game releases. Currently, core systems like menus, settings, input handling, and character controllers are rebuilt from scratch for each project, resulting in slower time-to-market and inconsistent code quality despite the studio's track record of 3-4 successful games generating significant side income.

The solution leverages Unreal Engine 5.5.4 as a foundation, integrating the NEON plugin for HTML/JavaScript UI development with shadcn components. This creates a unique bridge enabling AI-assisted menu creation while maintaining the performance and capabilities of native UE5 development. The architecture prioritizes AI-readability through standardized naming conventions and comprehensive local documentation, positioning the studio to maximize productivity gains from modern AI development tools.
